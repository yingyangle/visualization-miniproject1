			<h3>Design and Development</h3>
			<p>
				During the design and development process we decided that because this dataset has a lot of demographic variables, it would be clearer to put gender and neighborhood demographics into pie charts so that clicking a slice in the pie chart will change the bar graph to show the count of students corresponding to that demographic. We believe that this is an intuitive way for the user to explore relationships between the variables and ultimately wanted to see the effects that gender and neighborhood could have on alcohol consumption. Some struggles we faced were trying to find data that showed insightful information and finding relationships between variables because there were many variables available in the dataset, and tying different visualizations together. A lesson learned was to put more time into the exploratory process prior to creating the visualizations.
