			<h3>Motivation</h3>
			<p>For this project, we are interested in investigating which demographic or personal information such as age, gender, academic performance, overall health, social life, and parental background might be correlated with alcohol consumption. From this data exploration, we want to gain some insight into the factors that may contribute to or result from alcohol consumption in high school students.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Design Rationale</h3>
			<p> The data we have are not temporal data but both ordinal data(age, academic performance, acohol consumption level, and etc) and nominal data(genders,demographic, etc). We decided to collect information through frequencies, proportion, and percentage and thought the best visualization methods for the dataset are pie chart and bar chart.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Design & Development</h3>
			<p>During the design and development process we decided that because this dataset has a lot of demographic variables, it would be clearer to put gender and neighborhood demographics into pie charts so that clicking a slice in the pie chart will change the bar graph to show the count of students corresponding to that demographic. We believe that this is an intuitive way for the user to explore relationships between the variables and ultimately wanted to see the effects that gender and neighborhood could have on alcohol consumption. Some struggles we faced were trying to find data that showed insightful information and finding relationships between variables because there were many variables available in the dataset, and tying different visualizations together. A lesson learned was to put more time into the exploratory process prior to creating the visualizations.</p>
