			<h1>About</h1>
			<br>
			<h3>Motivation</h3>
			<p>For this project, we are interested in investigating which demographic or personal information such as age, gender, academic performance, overall health, social life, and parental background might be correlated with alcohol consumption. From this data exploration, we want to gain some insight into the factors that may contribute to or result from alcohol consumption in high school students.</p>
			<h3>Design Rationale</h3>
			<p> The data we have are not temporal data but both ordinal data(age, academic performance, acohol consumption level, and etc) and nominal data(genders,demographic, etc). We decided to collect information through frequencies, proportion, and percentage and thought the best visualization methods for the dataset are pie chart and bar chart.</p>
